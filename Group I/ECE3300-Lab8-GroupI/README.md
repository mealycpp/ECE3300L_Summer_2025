Lab 8: RGB LED PWM Controller

Group I: Julio Flores and Victor Perez

The objective of this lab is to design, implement, and test a RGB LED PWM Controller using VHDL (or Verilog) on the Nexys A7 FPGA development board. The circuit focuses on controlling brightness and blending colors through precise digital logic techniques such as PWM manipulation.
