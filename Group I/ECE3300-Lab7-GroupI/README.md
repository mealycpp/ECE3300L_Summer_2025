Lab 7: 16-bit Barrel Shifter / Rotator & 4-Digit 7-segment Display

Group I: Julio Flores and Victor Perez

The objective of this lab is to design, implement, and test a 16-bit barrel shifter and rotator using VHDL (or Verilog) on the Nexys A7 FPGA development board. The circuit allows for left or right shifting and rotating operations, controlled by user inputs using the 4 buttons and central reset button. Additionally, the output of the barrel shifter is displayed on a 4-digit 7-segment display to visualize the data in real-time. This lab reinforces digital design principles including data manipulation, control signal usage, and output interfacing through hardware display components.
