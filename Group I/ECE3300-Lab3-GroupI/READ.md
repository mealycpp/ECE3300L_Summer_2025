Lab 3 : 16x1 Multiplexer Using Nested 2x1 MUXes with Debounced Toggle Select Control

Group I: Julio Flores and Victor Perez

Lab Objective : The objective of this lab is to design and implement a 16-to-1 multiplexer using gate-level coding in Verilog by building it from 2-to-1 multiplexers. This lab incorporates toggle logic by using the Nexys A7-100T FPGA board’s pushbuttons to control the select lines to behave like switches. The 16 input lines are connected to the board’s switches through the (SW[15:0]), and the selected output is displayed on LED0. The design will be verified using testbenches and simulation in Vivado.
