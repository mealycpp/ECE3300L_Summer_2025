Lab 6: Dual BCD up/down counter, ALU, and Control Display on 7-segment display

Group I: Julio Flores and Victor Perez

The objective of this lab was to design and implement a digital system that combines two independent BCD up/down counters, a simple 4-bit ALU capable of performing addition and subtraction, and a control-display interface using switches and a 7-segment display. The lab aimed to demonstrate key digital logic concepts including clock division, hardware-based counting, and arithmetic operations using combinational logic. By using switches for ALU operation selection and counter direction control, the system provides an interactive way to explore how control logic affects computation and display output. The design also incorporated debugging tools such as LEDs to visualize raw BCD counter values and verify correct system behavior.
