Lab 4: Switch to 7 Segment Display Interface on NEXYS A7

Group I: Julio Flores and Victor Perez

Lab Objective : In this lab we will be showing number system conversions and FPGA design using Verilog and the Nexys A7 board. By implementing slide switches, 7-segment displays, and mirror LEDS, we will translate 4-bit binary inputs into their corresponding hex and decimal values on the 7-segment displays. Also we utilize the decoderm multiplexer, and testbench verilog modules to verify that it works as intended.
