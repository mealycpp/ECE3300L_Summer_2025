Lab 5: BCD up/down counter on 7-segment display

Group I: Julio Flores and Victor Perez

The objective of this lab is to design and implement a two-digit BCD up/down counter using Verilog-HDL. The design incorporates a 32-bit clock divider and a 32Ã—1 multiplexer to enable five selectable counting speeds via slide switches. The counter's direction is controlled by BTN1, while BTN0 is used for asynchronous reset. The output is displayed on a dual-digit 7-segment display using multiplexing techniques. The final design is simulated, synthesized, programmed, and tested on the Nexys A7 FPGA board.
