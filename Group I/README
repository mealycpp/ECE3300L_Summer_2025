Lab 1 Switch â†” LED interface

Julio Flores and Victor Perez

Lab Objective: The objective of this lab is to design and implement a simple Verilog module that uses 16 input switches to drive 16 output LEDs on a FPGA. We implement HDL I/O mapping, apply constraints using XDC files, synthesize the design, and program the FPGA to verify the hardware.
