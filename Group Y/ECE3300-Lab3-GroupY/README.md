# ECE3300-Lab3-GroupY
Lab 3 16 to 1 MUX

Members: Heba Hafez and Sean Wygant

Lab Objective: In Verilog, students will design a 16-to-1 Multiplexer (MUX 16x1) using gate-level 2x1 multiplexers. The Nexyâ€™s A7 Board push buttons will be used to control the MUX with switch life behavior through applying debouncing and toggle flip-flops per bit. The MUX output will be displayed on LED0, with inputs fed from the 16 switches.
