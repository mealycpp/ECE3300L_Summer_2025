Lab 8 One RGB LED PWM Controller

Members: Heba Hafez and Sean Wygant

Lab Objective: In Lab 8 students will design and implement a hardware-controlled RGB LED brightness and color controller on the Nexys A7 FPGA using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). The system uses a single push button to sequentially load four parameters, PWM period (resolution), red duty cycle, green duty cycle, and blue duty cycle. The parameters are put into registers, enabling smooth color blending and brightness control.
