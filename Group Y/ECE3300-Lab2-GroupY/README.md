Lab 2 4 to 16 Decoder

Members: Heba Hafez and Sean Wygant

Lab Objective: In Lab 2, students will design, simulate, and implement a 4-to-16 decoder with an enable input. When the decoder is enabled, exactly one of its 16 outputs will be HIGH depending on the 4-bit input value. When disabled, all outputs remain LOW. Students will experience both gate-level (structural) and behavioral Verilog coding, write a self-checking testbench, and analyze Vivadoâ€™s resource utilization and timing reports.
