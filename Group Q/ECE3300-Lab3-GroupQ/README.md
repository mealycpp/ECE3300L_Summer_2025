Lab 3 16x1 Mux using nested 2x1 mux with debounced toggle select control

Members: Kevin Tang and Jared Mocling

Lab Objective: We will design a 16-to-1 multiplexer (MUX16x1) using gate-level 2x1 multiplexers in Verilog. We will control the MUX using the push buttons on the Nexys A7 board, which must behave like switches using toggle logic. This requires implementing a debouncing system and a toggle flip-flop for each select bit. The output of the multiplexer will be shown on LED0, while the inputs will be fed from the 16 switches (SW[15:0])
