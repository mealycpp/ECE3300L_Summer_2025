Lab 2: 4Ã—16 Decoder Design on Nexys A7-100T FPGA

Members: Kevin Tang and Jared Mocling

Lab Objective: In this lab, we will design, simulate, and implement a 4-to-16 decoder with an enable input. When
enabled, exactly one of 16 outputs goes HIGH based on the 4-bit input; when disabled, all
outputs are LOW.
