# ECE3300 Lab 1 - Pin Mapping with XDC

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to map switches to LEDs using an XDC constraints file on the Nexys A7100T ECE FPGA trainer board. The goal was to enable LED 0 with Switch 0, LED 1 with Switch 1, and so on.

## Features
- Mapped switches to corresponding LEDs via XDC constraints.
- Used Vivado to set up the project, write the main file, and generate the bitstream.
- Verified functionality and resource utilization using the Vivado tools.

## Tools Used
- Vivado Design Suite
- Nexys A7100T FPGA Board

## Group Members
- **Justin Herrera** – Report writing, datasheet review, and switch-to-LED mapping (40%)
- **Nathan Rahbar** – XDC file, main Verilog file, Vivado project setup (60%)

## Floor Plan & Resource Usage
The project includes an analysis of flip-flop and LUT count, and a floorplan to visualize resource usage.

## Conclusion
This lab served as an introduction to:
- Creating and managing FPGA projects in Vivado
- Writing and editing constraint and HDL files
- Understanding FPGA resource utilization and basic digital system design
