Lab 2

In this lab we design a 4x16 decoder in Verilog

We were able to verify results via a written Testbench
We were able to analyze LUT and FF count with and analyze utilization data
Succeded in designing a 4x16 decoder with behavioural and gate level logic in which 4 inputs activated 1 of 16 outputs, represented by switches and LEDs respectively.
