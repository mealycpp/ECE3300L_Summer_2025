Description:
In this lab, we developed a Verilog module for the Nexys A7 100T Board. The goal of this lab was to read 16 switches that drives 16 LED's. We accomplished this by creating a module named switch_led_interface which includes a 16 bit input bus named sw and 16 bit output bus named led. We then used a continuous assignment to map each switch to each led.
