Lab 1: LED Interface

Members: Rohan Walia and Parsa Ghasemi

Lab Objective: Using Verilog and the Digilent Nexys A7-100T development board, we made a module that directly maps a 16-bit input bus to a 16-bit ouptut bus. With a constraint file, we mapped the 16 switches on the dev board to the input bus and the 16 LED's on the dev board to the output bus.
