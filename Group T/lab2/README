Lab 2
Kevin Yu and Noah Bocanegra
You will design, simulate, and implement a 4-to-16 decoder with an enable input. When
enabled, exactly one of 16 outputs goes HIGH based on the 4-bit input; when disabled, all
outputs are LOW. You will practice:
• Gate-level (structural) coding in Verilog
• Behavioral coding in Verilog (with color-coded comments)
• Writing a self-checking testbench
• Reading Vivado’s resource utilization and timing reports
• Documenting your work in a clear, beginner-friendly report
