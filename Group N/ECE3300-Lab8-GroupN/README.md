ECE3300L Lab8:

Members: Daniel Mondragon and Kobe Aquino

Lab Objective: 
Build a hardware-controlled RGB LED using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). You’ll follow the same process
and repo structure as Lab 7.
With one button, you’ll load:
Resolution (PWM Period)
Red duty cycle
Green duty cycle
Blue duty cycle
This lab helps you control brightness and blend colors with digital logic. Every step contributes to a working
RGB LED controller.
